  "description": "IntelliX: AI-driven and Openly Programmable Oracle Network IntelliX introduces a new class of blockchain oracles designed to bridge the gap between complex, unstructured off-chain data and blockchain systems. These AI-driven oracles leverage advanced multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) to process and interpret a wide range of unstructured data formats, including text, images and video footage. By transforming this diverse data into structured, actionable insights, IntelliX oracles enable smart contracts to operate with a level of sophistication and contextual awareness previously unattainable.",
